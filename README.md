# AI-ML-Security---Red-Teaming-Malicious-ONNX-DDOS-Hidden-Payload-
Proof-of-concept ONNX exploit demonstrating how base64-obfuscated Python payloads embedded in model metadata can trigger file cloning and resource exhaustion — simulating a stealthy DDoS attack vector in ML pipelines.

# 📦 What is ONNX?
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is a widely adopted format that allows interoperability between different machine learning frameworks. ONNX models are composed of computation graphs, weights, and optional metadata fields (metadata_props), which can be used to store additional information like author, version, or tags.

However, these metadata fields are unregulated and can be misused to embed arbitrary, obfuscated Python code — turning a legitimate model into a vector for resource-based attacks.

# 🚨 Exploit Overview: Metadata-Based Payload for DDoS via File Cloning
In this proof-of-concept, a Python payload is injected into an ONNX model’s metadata_props. The payload is Base64-encoded and embedded under the "run" key.

# 💣 Behavior Upon Execution:
When executed (via exec()), the payload:

1. Creates 10 copies of the infected model using shutil.copyfile().
2. Writes files named copy_0.onnx to copy_9.onnx.
3. Repeats the I/O operation, causing disk consumption and CPU load.
4. Although harmless in appearance, when done repeatedly or at scale, this becomes a Denial of Service (DoS) vector.

# 🔬 Attack Flow
1. Payload Injection into Model
2. Payload Triggered on Load

# 🧪 Test Results
Upon loading:
  - Ten ONNX file clones are written to disk.
  - No warnings or alerts are triggered by onnx.load().
  - Resource usage spikes momentarily (disk I/O and CPU).
When deployed at scale (e.g., multiple users loading the model in parallel), this results in:
  - Disk exhaustion
  - Performance degradation
  - Potential system instability

# ☠️ Real-World Impact
# 🔄 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
If the model is distributed via public platforms (e.g., Hugging Face, GitHub) and integrated into automated pipelines, this small-scale clone script can amplify across many machines, leading to a distributed attack.

# 💡 Variants
1. Cloning thousands of files recursively.
2. Creating infinite loops or massive memory buffers.
3. Recursive payload execution (multi-layered propagation).

# 🛡️ Mitigation & Defense Strategies
1. ❌ Never Execute Model Metadata
Avoid exec()/eval() on metadata fields at all costs. Treat metadata as non-executable strings.

# 2. 🔍 Metadata Auditing
Implement scanners to detect:
- Suspicious keywords: exec, import, os, shutil, base64, etc.
- Base64 strings with decode patterns.
- Abnormally large metadata fields.

# 3. 🧪 Model Sandbox Execution
Use containerized environments (e.g., Docker) with strict resource limits for testing model behavior.

# 4. 🔐 Use Trusted Repositories
Only use ONNX models from official or verified sources. Treat user-uploaded models as potentially malicious.

# 5. 🧰 Secure Model Pipeline
Add:
  - Metadata sanitization tools.
  - Digital signature validation.
  - Structural validation before inference deployment.
